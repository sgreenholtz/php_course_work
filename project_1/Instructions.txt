Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result. Create a simple mad-lib webpage that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create and outputs it below the input boxes and saves the the inputs and generated story to the database. Then displays all the completed stories below in order of newest to oldest.
