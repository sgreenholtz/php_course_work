<?php
/*
Create a PHP script called addProduct.php that will allow you to enter new product information into a form and save it to a database

You might want to have a selection control that will display a different form based on whether you are adding a generic product, a tool,
or electronics to the database

Although you have a lot of flexibility, consider adding methods to the appropriate classes for handling the specific database insertions
depending upon the product type

Although not required, you could even create separate methods in the different classes that handle the form entry depending upon the product
type
