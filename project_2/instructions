You’ll often need to see if one value is within a certain range and alter the flow of a program as a result.
Create a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a person using their height in inches and weight in pounds. 
The program should prompt the user for weight and height.

Calculate the BMI by using the following formula: bmi = (weight / (height × height)) * 703

If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display that the person is at a normal weight. 
If they are out of that range, tell them if they are underweight or overweight and tell them to consult their doctor.
