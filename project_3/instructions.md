We need a blog to share our learnings and increase our marketability.
Create a blog system that allows you to write posts, set a title and date them.
Also create a web interface to administer the blog.
This administrative interface should be password protected in some way.

Constraints

The blog should be styled, use something like bootstrap or a pre-built theme.
It is not acceptable to use an already built blogging engine.

Going beyond

To really push yourself find a javascript or CSS plugin that styles code examples
many of them will just require you to put in <pre> to start your code sample and </pre> to end it.

Add a WYSIWYG editor to your admin interface for the blog entries.
